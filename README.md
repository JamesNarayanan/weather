This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

To get the project running, you can use the following commands:
### `npm install`

Installs the necessary dependencies to /node_modules

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

It then pushes the production build to the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/JamesNarayanan/weather/tree/gh-pages) on github.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
